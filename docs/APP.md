## Behavior
- All geometry is tracked in math coordinates.
- The left canvas shows the C-triangle or manual `c_i` controls.
- The right canvas shows `g_c`, pair compositions, or the six-step composition.
- Strict mode exposes `strictEps` and updates the admissible-set checks and local `c` bounds.
- The point tool is available in Triangle, `c_i`, Circle, and Free modes.  A click inside the hexagon creates a seed point; each seed contributes its de-duplicated D6 orbit to the coverability check.  Seed handles can be dragged, deleted, or cleared.  Clicks and drags outside the hexagon are ignored.
- D6 points are covered by the active mode's coverers: C-triangle plus generated V-triangles in Triangle mode, generated V-triangles in `c_i` mode, C-circle plus generated V-triangles in Circle mode, and all seven placed triangles in Free mode.
- Point seeds are included in the Controller State JSON and in the Free State JSON.

## `ab union` mode

The `ab union` shape mode ports the standalone
[region explorer](../legacy/research/hex_region_app.html) into the normal app interface.

- Use `Move`, `Add`, and `Delete` to edit boundary dots on each edge `e_i=[V_i,V_{i+1}]`.
- Use `d-mark` and `s-mark` to label intersections between the active C-triangle or C-circle boundary and the fixed skeleton. `D` labels recompute when the geometry changes; `S` labels keep the point created at click time.
- Use `f mark` to place free dots inside the hexagon; two dots show their blue distance, and three or more show the optimized yellow enclosing equilateral triangle.
- Each edge has one shared dot or two ordered dots.  On `e_i`, the left dot gives `b_i`; the right dot gives `a_{i+1}` by distance from the right endpoint.
- Click `V_i` to toggle the boundary of `R_i`.  In `Move`, a left split dot toggles `R_i`, a right split dot toggles `R_{i+1}`, and a shared dot toggles both.
- `original AB union` controls the shaded exact covered-region fill.
- `visible regions` checkboxes control which individual `R_i` fills contribute to the shaded overlays.
- `hex-axis hull` shows the hull overlay and uses it for the sampled mask. It replaces each row with `a_i+b_i < 1` by a hex-axis hull using adjacent-edge boundary hits. Near `a_i+b_i=1`, it adds local top-start/top-end cuts to reduce the upper/right excess while preserving sampled containment.
- `show purple triangle` toggles the sampled enclosing equilateral triangle. `auto optimize theta` updates it to the sampled best angle after completed AB changes; disabling auto restores the manual theta slider and optimize button.
- `show red pair > 1` continuously searches the red uncovered region for a sampled pair farther than distance `1` and draws the witness when found.
- `clip to corner sectors` clips `R_i` to the sector bounded by the adjacent half-diagonals; locally this is `0 <= u <= 1` and `0 <= v <= 1`.
- The center dropdown can show no center shape, the draggable C-triangle, the draggable C-circle, or the manual `c_i` convex hull. `lock center` freezes the active center geometry but still allows changing the center mode.
- Mark sources are hexagon edges, half-diagonals, and the active C-triangle or C-circle boundary. Manual `c_i` hulls and `R_i` boundaries are not mark sources.
- Labels on perimeter edges show one-time snap buttons and persistent lock checkboxes for the eligible edge dot. Snaps and locks respect the existing `same a` and `same b` lock groups.
- The region table includes `same a` and `same b` checkboxes. Checked values move as locked groups while preserving the edge-dot order.

## `Hull debug` mode

`Hull debug` is a diagnostic local view for inspecting one `R(a,b)` set and sketching a desired hex-axis hull when `a+b<1`. The default example is `a=0.20`, `b=0.50`.

- The canvas shows the full local hexagon footprint in coordinates where `u` points from `V_i` to `V_{i+1}`, and `v` points from `V_i` to `V_{i-1}`.
- The exact sampled AB-union set, required points, and adjacent-edge boundary hits are drawn as references.
- `load suggested hull` replaces the current polygon with the code-generated hex-axis hull for strict rows with `a+b<1`; for `a+b>=1`, no suggested hull is shown.
- Click to add polygon vertices. On a closed polygon, click an edge to insert a new dot on that edge.
- Drag vertices to adjust them while preserving snapped edge directions where possible.
- Select a dot and use `delete selected dot`, Backspace, or Delete to remove it while preserving local axis alignment.
- Close the polygon to check whether it contains all sampled exact-region points. Missed samples are highlighted in red, and the vertex list is shown for copying.
- `export current` appends the current `a`, `b`, polygon vertices, and sampled coverage data to the experiment JSON. Repeated exports stay in the same JSON block until `clear exports`.
- This mode is exploratory only; it does not change the normal `ab union` mask or hull algorithm.

## `Max Area` and `Area Conj` modes

The area function $f(a,b)$ is the maximum of
$\operatorname{area}(T\cap H)/(\sqrt3/4)$ over closed unit equilateral
triangles containing a hexagon vertex and the two required adjacent-edge
points at distances $a,b$ from it. Thus $f$ measures normalized inside area,
and $1-f$ measures normalized outside area.

- `Max Area` numerically searches one pair $(a,b)$, draws its best triangle candidate, and reports $f$ and $1-f$.
- `Area Conj` uses the six boundary rows to search each local area problem and reports $\sum_i f_i$ and $\sum_i(1-f_i)$.
- Both modes retain coarse/high search quality and optional T3-like restrictions. The row sum controls include $a+b=1$ and $a+b=1+\delta$. Displayed search values are numerical estimates.

The area inequality is proved by Strategy 2 of the paper: for feasible cyclic
handoffs $(a_i,b_i)=(1-x_{i-1},x_i)$ with $x_i\in(0,1)$ and at least two
supercritical rows $a_i+b_i>1$,
$\sum_{i=0}^5 f(a_i,b_i)<99/20<5$. Together with strict handoff selection,
this rules out a cover of the filled hexagon by seven open unit triangles in
the zero-gap branch with at least two actual supercritical vertex triangles.

and [paper proof](https://github.com/dylan0301/hexagon-cover-database/blob/a98c71c12f1b521a1e58353e56b11474e1ec4f9b/arrange/paper_draft/05_area_loss_full.tex).
The proof uses unconditional area-loss bounds; it does not require the
historical conjecture about the shape of an area-maximizing triangle.

## `Core Case` mode

`Core Case` is a diagnostic AB-union slice for the core obstruction case.
Its six-point model is an exploratory predecessor to Strategy 3's completed
nine-point obstruction: six radial points and three AB-frontier points rule
out the zero-gap branch with exactly one actual supercritical vertex triangle,
independently of C and V types. See [Core Case definitions and proof status](CORE_CASE.md).
The Strategy 3 F graph measures an enclosing triangle's side length; the Area modes'
$f(a,b)$ measures normalized inside area.

- The mode enforces `a4+b4>1` and `a0+b0,a1+b1,a2+b2<=1`.
- The control panel has independent checkboxes for forcing `a3+b3=1` and `a5+b5=1`; when unchecked, those rows use `<=1` instead.
- The `hard limit` checkbox clamps dot drags at the active constraints instead of letting unrelated dots move to repair them.
- The canvas reuses the AB-union overlay, then draws the two full radius-1 circles centered at `X2` and `X5`.
- It can mark the two `R4`/circle intersections and three diagonal red-witness points.
- The point table has a `use` checkbox for each point. Unchecked points are hidden on the canvas and excluded from the enclosing-triangle fit.
- If no points are checked, the triangle side is unavailable until at least one point is re-enabled.

## Strategy 3 modes

- `S3 BC (6 points)` explores a selected gap, the center midpoint, and three
  total radial endpoints.
- `S3 D (4 points)` explores the supported-rescuer construction.
- `S3 F (9 points)` replaces the earlier Core `f(a,b)` graph with six radial
  and three analytic frontier witnesses. It retains the surface, heatmap,
  sample quality, point selection, and slice controls.

BC and D have independent `Parameters` and `V triangles` views. Triangle
controls reuse Free's selection, translation, and rotation interaction.
The enclosing triangle is a numerical fit to the selected witnesses;
condition readouts describe applicability of the paper's construction.
See [Strategy 3 definitions and controls](STRATEGY3.md) for the precise scopes
and snapshot migration.
